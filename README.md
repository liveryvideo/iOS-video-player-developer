Developers wanted - Amsterdam - full-time

We’re looking for an iOS developer who enjoys digging around the lower layers of Apple’s video tools (including AVFoundation, VideoToolbox, and CoreMedia). Your job will be to improve our low-latency video player, with a focus on developing its ability to support synced playback, multi-bitrate video, and interactive overlays. In addition to our video player, you will be involved in the development of the native HTML wrapper solution we use for all of our applications.

## What you’ll be working on

If you’re looking to make an impact, this role is for you: your job is to help define the best architecture to support Livery and the product roadmap, and the solutions you develop will be used by all native iOS clients. You will collaborate with the Livery team to integrate the latest low-latency video streaming technology into our native player, and translate general requirements into specific solutions for the iOS ecosystem. Responsibilities include developing the iOS video player and maintaining our native wrappers. The ideal candidate has a solid understanding of Objective-C / Swift, a passion for video and live streaming, and a knack for developing iOS solutions using Apple’s video tools (including AVFoundation, VideoToolbox, and CoreMedia).
- Develop with Objective-C / Swift using AVFoundation, VideoToolbox, and CoreMedia
- Contribute to the development of the iOS Livery Player and native wrappers
- Translate new features from the roadmap to the iOS ecosystem
- Collaborate with colleagues from the CMS, player, and platform teams
